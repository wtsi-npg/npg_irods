Release 2.51.0 (2024-10-25)
 - Banish more Sequels

Release 2.50.1 (2024-10-04)
 - Remove sequel specific references to Sequel from the code
 - Following a release on 07/09/2024, see https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/changes
   the checksum of the script served by https://install.perlbrew.pl had changed.
   https://install.perlbrew.pl is a redirect to raw
   https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/perlbrew-install, so
   the change originates from GitHub and can be trusted. Our CI flow compares
   the checksum of the downloaded script to the expected value. We now store
   an updated expected checksum value, which corresponds to the latest release.

Release 2.50.0 (2024-08-07)
 - SMRT Link IsoSeq analysis has changed substantially in SMRT Link v13
   so old code and tests related to this was removed - further work is
   planned in this area to remove the Sequel subdirectory entirely. As
   it is an evolving area in sporadic use the loading code for IsoSeq
   analysis was moved to a separate new IsoSeqPublisher module.
     - added new WTSI::NPG::HTS::PacBio::Sequel::IsoSeqPublisher module
       which handles loading of analysis output from SMRT Link
       pb_segment_reads_and_isoseq jobs
     - old code for IsoSeq loading completely removed from
       WTSI::NPG::HTS::PacBio::Sequel::AnalysisPublisher

Release 2.49.2
 - Prevent access to a live mlwh database from tests.

Release 2.49.1

 - Allow non deplexed Revio cells to publish now
 - Analysis loading changes post SMRT Link v13
   Remove very old test data and update some tests. Add new test data and minor
   code change to support loading of data from deplexing jobs in SMRT Link v13+
   (very rare as only done when deplexing on instrument is incorrect).

Release 2.48.0
 - Add sequencing_control.subreads.bam and index file to PacBio run
   archiving. These files can be used to regenerate QC metrics.
 - Add new (SMRT Link v13+) reports.zip file to PacBio Revio data 
   archiving.

Release 2.47.1

  - Amended policy on archival of index files. No longer skipping
    index files if there are no reads.

Release 2.47.0

  - Fixed some outdated POD
  - 'alt_target' iRODS metadata attribute value is now computed in the
    same way as the 'target' metadata attribute value. To be consistent
    with prior practice, the 'alt_target' value is assigned only when it
    is true. This resolves the issue of tag zero files, which are
    produced by the alternative process, previously having 'alt_target'
    metadata attribute value of 1.
  - Following introduction of ss_<STUDY_ID>_human iRODS groups to
    provide limited access to split-out human data and consolidation
    of logic about assignment of study_related iRODS groups in
    https://github.com/wtsi-npg/perl-irods-wrap/pull/297, the following
    changes were made:
      - contains_nonconsented_human and update_group_permissions methods
        were dropped from WTSI::NPG::HTS::Illumina::AlnDataObject
      - ss_<STUDY_ID>_human iRODS groups were added to test fixtures

 - Only add run-, lane- or plex-level metadata (id_run=x, lane=y,
   tag_index=z) on merged data when all the constituents are from the
   same run, lane or plex. E.g.

   run 1000, lane 1; run 1001, lane 1 gives lane=1
   
   run 1000, lane 1, plex 2; run 1000, lane 2, plex 2;
   run 1000, lane 3, plex 2 gives id_run=1000, tag_index=2

 - Use tears -d to ensure the default iRODS server is used (avoids
   a HEIRARCHY_ERROR when using getHostForGet cross-zone).

 - Added tar file auditor.
 - Use manifest checksums to confirm file contents.
 - Support loading PacBio RSII files created using out of date reagents.
 - Allow a user-supplied checksum to be used in TarPublisher and TarStream
   (so GridIONRunPublisher can allow the checksum of uncompressed data to be used).
 - Publish fastq files during the catchup phase.
 - Allow auditing of older GridION tar files which used a relative path for
   tarred files.
 - Archiving changes for illumina sequencing genotype files.
 - Fix for the regex used when choosing to ignore files.

Release 2.2

   but will cause a no-zero exit of the loading script.

 - Bug fix: Failure to make an MD5 cache file is reduced from a fatal
   error to a warning.

 - Warnings now come through the logger, rather than raw carping,
   so they gain a WARN tag.

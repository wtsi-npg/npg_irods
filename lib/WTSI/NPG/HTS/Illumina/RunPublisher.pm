=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::HTS::Illumina::RunPublisher

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Publishes alignment, QC and ancillary files to iRODS, adds metadata and
sets permissions.

An instance of RunPublisher is responsible for copying Illumina
sequencing data from the instrument run folder to a collection in
iRODS for one or more data products, each of which is identified by a
JSON "composition" file describing the sample(s) within.

Files releated to a product are referred to in the API by their
product "name", which is the same as the string used as a prefix when
naming composition JSON files. i.e.

 <name>.composition.json

All files that are part of a product must share this name prefix.

Data files are divided into categories:

 - XML files; run metadata produced by the instrument.
 - InterOp files; run data produced by the instrument.
 - alignment files; the sequencing reads in BAM or CRAM format.
 - alignment index files; indices in the relevant format
 - ancillary files; files containing information about the run
 - genotype files; files with genotype calls from sequenced reads.
 - QC JSON files; JSON files containing information about the run.

A RunPublisher provides methods to list the files in these categories
and to copy ("publish") them. File publishing is recursive below the
source directory. The relative path of a file under source directory
on the local filesystem is used to create the same relative path in
iRODS, beneath the destination collection.

As part of the copying process, metadata are added to, or updated on,
the files in iRODS. Following the metadata update, access permissions
are set. The information to do both of these operations is provided by
an instance of st::api::lims.

If a product is published multiple times to the same destination
collection, the following take place:

 - the RunPublisher checks local (run folder) file checksums against
   remote (iRODS) checksums and will not make unnecessary updates.

 - if a local file has changed, the copy in iRODS will be overwritten
   and additional metadata indicating the time of the update will be
   added.

 - the RunPublisher will proceed to make metadata and permissions
   changes to synchronise with the metadata supplied by st::api::lims,
   even if no files have been modified.

Caveats:

If you are publishing several products concurrently, take care that
you select a different restart file for each job.
